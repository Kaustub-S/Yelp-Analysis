## Analysis of Yelps dataset and influence of gender in rankings
This project combined the publicly available Social Security data and the popular Yelp dataset <br>
<br>
To better understand user influence, I conducted a project where the SS data was used in conjunction with Yelp data by breaking down First and Last names to determine gender <br>
<br>
With this, other in-depth analysis was conducted regarding different aspects of Yelp and its credibility. <br>
